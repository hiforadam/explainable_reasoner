{"input": "Why is fine tuning important in modern LLM systems?", "output": "The primary role of fine-tuning is to adapt a pretrained model to a specific task or behavioral target since it updates weights (or adapters) using examples that reflect the desired outputs and constraints.

{"input": "Why is evaluation important in modern LLM systems?", "output": "Benchmarks often fail to measure reasoning because they can be narrow, predictable, and artifact-heavy and this leads to models may exploit shortcuts or memorize patterns that look like reasoning under the benchmark distribution.

{"input": "What is the main limitation of hallucinations, and why? Provide the best answer.", "output": "The main cause of hallucinations is optimizing plausibility without sufficient grounding since next-token training rewards fluent continuations even when they are not supported by evidence.
